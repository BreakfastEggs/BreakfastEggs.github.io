##### I am an illustrator/multimedia artist with dreams of becoming a character designer for video games. I'm obsessed with Nintendo!

##### Born in Puerto Rico, raised in New York.

I'm a Hispanic artist, trying to make a living out of art. I love to play video games that influence adventure and creativity, creating characters with some unique designs. I love to base my designs off of mythical creatures, keeping my characters diverse and exciting.

I was raised in Brooklyn, New York, In a small town where it was calm and peaceful. New York is well-known for its diversity and creativity, artwork all over its walls. Brooklyn is one of the many hot spots for artist murals, and I love to show this kind of diversity and creativity in my work.

Art is what keeps my going in my daily life, I'm not sure what I would be without it. I strive to better my skill in art on a day to day basis, drawing whenever and wherever. I love to experiment and change things constantly; researching, and practicing every minute of the day. Art is and will forever be a part of my life, and I will work hard to achieve my dream.
